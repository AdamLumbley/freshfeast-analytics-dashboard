# FreshFeast Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
FreshFeast Boxes is a fictional subscription meal kit business.  
This project simulates a transactional relational database and demonstrates end-to-end business intelligence using SQL and Power BI to analyze customer behavior, revenue trends, product performance, and promotion effectiveness.

I designed the database schema, wrote analytical SQL queries, and built an executive dashboard to translate raw data into actionable business insights.

## 🔍 Key Business Insights

- **Revenue concentrated in higher tiers:** Premium and mid-tier customers generate the majority of total revenue, highlighting strong upsell opportunities.
- **Top products drive most sales:** A small subset of products accounts for most revenue, suggesting focused inventory and marketing strategies.
- **Ordering patterns over time:** Clear demand peaks indicate opportunities for improved forecasting, staffing, and campaign timing.
- **Promotions increase volume but reduce order value:** Discounts boost transactions but often lower average revenue, requiring balanced pricing strategy.
- **Repeat customers have higher lifetime value:** Returning customers contribute significantly more cumulative revenue, emphasizing retention initiatives.

These findings demonstrate how SQL-driven analysis can directly support business decisions.
